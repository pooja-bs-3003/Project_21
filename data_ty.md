# DATA TYPES IN MACHINE LEARNING:

### CATEGORICAL

1. NOMINAL

2. ORDINAL

   

### NUMERICAL

1. INTERVAL

2. RATIO

   Most data can be categorized into 4 basic types from a Machine Learning  perspective: numerical data, categorical data, time-series data, and  text.

   # Numerical Data

   Numerical data is any data where data points are exact numbers. Statisticians also might call numerical data, quantitative data. 

   Numerical data can be characterized by continuous or discrete data.  Continuous data can assume any value within a range whereas discrete  data has distinct values.

   A simple way to describe the difference between the two is to visualize a scatter plot graph vs. a line graph. ![Continuous data and discrete data examples](https://learn.g2.com/hubfs/G2CR_B071_Discrete_vs_Continuous_Data_V1.png)

# Categorical Data

Categorical Data is the data that generally takes a limited number of  possible values. Also, the data in the category need not be numerical,  it can be textual in nature. All machine learning models are some kind  of mathematical model that need numbers to work with. This is one of the primary reasons we need to pre-process the categorical data before we  can feed it to machine learning models.

### ORDINAL DATA:

Categories are ordered in some particular manner.

#### example:  sizes of shirts,shoes size.

### NOMINAL DATA:

While doing categories order is not important.

#### example:  seasons

# Time Series Data

Time series data is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period 



# Text

Text data  represents words, phrases & sentences. A lot of the time the first thing that  you do with text is you turn it into numbers using some interesting  functions like the bag of words formulation.
